# JavaScript is the programming language of the World Wide Web.
As a professional web software developer, you will not only need to know how to program in this simple yet powerful language, but you will need to understand the fundamentals of how data is exchanged on the World Wide Web (WWW) and what tools and frameworks are available to you for creating robust, interactive web applications. This course, part of the CS Essentials for Software Development Professional Certificate series, provides an introduction to modern web development using JavaScript. In addition to exploring the basics of web page creation using HTML and CSS, you will learn advanced web page layout and responsive design tools such as Bootstrap. You will also learn how browsers represent a web page data using the Document Object Model (DOM) and how to develop dynamic, interactive web pages using JavaScript in the browser. Beyond fundamental JavaScript syntax and advanced language features such as callbacks, events, and asynchronous programming, you will work with jQuery, which provides functionality for simplified DOM manipulation and event handling.

This course is on programming for the web and JavaScript the course introduce me to modern tools and frameworks in web development. But also give me the foundation that you I need as an aspirrinf web developer by focusing on the three core technologies HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
